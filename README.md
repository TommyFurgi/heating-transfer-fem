# Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

* **Python 3.10**: The programming language used for implementing the FEM solution.
* **numpy**: A library for numerical computations and handling large datasets.
* **matplotlib**: A library for generating visualizations and plots to represent the results of the heating transfer analysis.

# Setup
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone 
    ```

2. **Change into the Project Directory**
    Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd heating-transfer-fem
    ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
    Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install Required Packages**
    Install the required Python packages specified in the requirements.txt file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the Main Script**
    Execute the `main.py` script to run the analysis:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
